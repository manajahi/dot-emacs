Goals:
- Focus on Racket (not various Schemes).
- Fontify all Racket keywords, builtins, and so on.
- Fontify variations of define for functions and variables.
- Indent Racket forms (even `for/fold` and `for*/fold`).
- Follow DrRacket concepts where applicable.
- Compatible with Emacs 24.2+.

Acknowledgements:

- Obviously the existing Emacs Scheme mode and Inferior Scheme mode.

- The source code for Neil Van Dyke's Quack provided a model for
  many of the scheme-indent-function settings, smart paren closing,
  and pretty lambda.
